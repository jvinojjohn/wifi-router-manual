# Setup Instructions

Setting up your router takes just a few minutes.

## Step 1. Connect the hardware
1. Plug the power adapter into the router and a wall outlet.
2. Connect the WAN port on the router to your modem using the included Ethernet cable.
3. Wait until the router’s power LED turns solid green.

## Step 2. Access the setup page
1. Connect your computer or phone to the default Wi-Fi network (printed on the label underneath the router).
2. Open a browser and visit **http://192.168.0.1** or **http://router.local**.
3. Log in using the default username and password (also on the label).

## Step 3. Configure Wi-Fi
1. Change the network name (SSID) to something unique.
2. Set a strong password — at least 12 characters.
3. Save your settings; the router will restart.

> **Note:** After restart, reconnect your devices using the new network name and password.
